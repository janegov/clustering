# clustering
Perform classification of the  MNIST database  (or a sufficiently small subset of it) using:

mixture of Gaussians with diagonal covariance (Gaussian Naive Bayes with latent class label);
mean shift;
normalized cut.
The unsupervised classification must be performed at varying levels of dimensionality reduction through PCA  (say going from 2 to 200) In order to asses the effect of the dimensionality in accuracy and learning time.


Provide the code and the extracted clusters as the number of clusters k varies from 5 to 15, for the mixture of Gaussians and normalized-cut, while for mean shift vary the kernel width. For each value of k (or kernel width) provide the value of the Rand index:

R=2(a+b)/(n(n-1))

where
n is the number of images in the dataset.
a is the number of pairs of images that represent the same digit and that are clustered together.
b is the number of pairs of images that represent different digits and that are placed in different clusters.
Explain the differences between the three models.

Tip: the means of the Gaussian models can be visualized as a greyscale images after PCA reconstruction to inspect the learned model.
